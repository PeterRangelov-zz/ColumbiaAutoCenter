            <p>The story of our auto shop begins and ends with putting customers first. We want to earn your trust and respect. In turn, we hope to build a long-lasting relationship where you are not just a customer â€“ but part of a family of customers for life.</p>
            <p>We opened in 1985 as a collision repair facility. As we continued to earn the trust of our customers, we expanded into an auto mechanical repair facility.</p>
            <p>We employ more than a dozen certified technicians who are thoroughly trained on domestic and foreign vehicles. The majority of our technicians have more than 10 years of experience, and our elite training and superior service enables our mechanics to keep up with the most relevant solutions to your vehicle needs.</p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on customer service with our front-end office staff who will keep you informed every step of the way. Our staff will explain specifically what needs to be done to your vehicle and what preventative maintenance can be done to avoid costly repairs in the future.</p>
            <p>Our experienced technicians manage the entire repair process, making sure no detail is overlooked and your vehicle is repaired correctly the first time. We guarantee our work and make sure your vehicle is safe to drive when it leaves the shop.</p>

            <p>We focus on providing high-quality service at extremely competitive and honest prices. We also focus on educating our customers on what they can do as owners to keep their vehicles in tip-top condition.</p>
            <p>It has been a privilege to work within the Columbia community for nearly 30 years, and we are looking forward to helping our customers get back on the road quickly and safely.</p>
            <p>Thank you for considering us.</p>
